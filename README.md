# Deno Module Starter

A neat lil starter for Deno modules.

## IDE integration

For VSCode, make sure you have the
[Deno](https://github.com/denoland/vscode_deno) extension installed. Then, open
the project and run the editor command

```
> deno: init
```

## Publishing

Follow the instructions on [deno.land/x/](https://deno.land/x/) to publish a
Deno module there.
